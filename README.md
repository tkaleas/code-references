# Code References

I recently went searching for some old reference cheatsheets that used to exist for Houdini and found that I was completely unable to find them in my bookmarks tab, files, or wherever I was actually searching for it.

Having realized I should be keeping most of my personal references in a standard place,  I've decided it would be beneficial to just keep everything in a Github repo that I will try to periodically update. 

As a lot of these technologies are constantly changing, hopefully a lot of content here will continue 

Hopefully this repository will be useful to someone else too.
