Problem Solving Steps
1 Listen
2 Example
3 Brute Force
4 Optimize
5 Walk Through
6 Implement
7 Test

#### BUD
Bottlenecks
Unnecessary Work
Duplicated Work

#### DIY
Solving problem manually, emergent algorithms might appear that might help solve: heuristics in head.

#### Simplify -> Generalize
Tweak for simplified easier version. Solve for general.

#### Base Case and Build
solve for n=1, build up to n=3/4
natural recursive algorithms

#### Data Structure Brainstorm
Run through data structures and discover the best one to use.
Become more intuitive with which data structure to use for which problem.
 
#### Best Conceivable Runtime
Best runtime possible given world of algorithms.

#### What Good Coding Looks Like
- Correct
- Efficient
- Simple
- Readable
- Maintainable
- Use data structures generously.
- Reuse Code Appropriately
- Modular Code
- Remember to error check

### Arrays and Strings
- Hash Table Collision Resolution
- Rabin-Karp Substring Search
